## _Real microscopy denoising dataset_

We collected dataset for real (fluorescence) widefield microscopy denoising, published in ECCV 2020 BioImage Computing (BIC) Workshop. It also contains data for super-resolution, with structured illumination ground-truth. It can thus be used for the joint image denoising and SR task.

It contains 144,000 images: **360 sets** each comprising **400 repeated captures** (4 times larger than the most recent prior work). Averaging 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 captures gives images with varying noise levels, and the ground-truth is obtained by averaging the 400 captures.

That dataset can be found [-> here <-](https://github.com/IVRL/w2s).
